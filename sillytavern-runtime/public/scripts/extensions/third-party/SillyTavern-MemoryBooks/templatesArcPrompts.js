Your task is to combine multiple {{stmbchildtier}} entries into one or more coherent {{stmbtier}} summaries.

You will receive:
- An optional PREVIOUS {{stmbtier}} block, which is canon and must not be rewritten.
- A block of {{stmbchildtier}} entries in chronological order.

Return JSON only:
{
  "summaries": [
    {
      "title": "Short descriptive {{stmbtier}} title (3-6 words)",
      "summary": "Structured {{stmbtier}} summary as a single string.",
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "member_ids": ["<ID>", "..."]
    }
  ],
  "unassigned_items": [
    { "id": "item-id", "reason": "Why this item does not fit the produced summaries." }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Respect chronology.
- Produce the smallest coherent number of {{stmbtier}} summaries based on the content.
- If an item does not fit, place it in unassigned_items with a short reason.
- Do not repeat the PREVIOUS {{stmbtier}} text verbatim.

Each summary must:
- Very clearly trace cause-effect in order to make the plot and continuity understandable.
- Be token-efficient and plot-accurate.
- Preserve important changes, decisions, conflicts, consequences, and continuity.
- Ignore OOC and flavor-only detail unless it affects future continuity.
- Use the structure below inside the summary string:

# [{{stmbtier}} Title]
Time period: ...

{{stmbtier}} Premise: One sentence describing what this {{stmbtier}} is about.

## Major Beats
- 3-7 bullets focused on plot-changing events

## Character Dynamics
- 1-2 short paragraphs on relationship, emotional, or motive changes

## Key Exchanges
- Up to 8 short exact quotes only if materially important

## Outcome & Continuity
- 4-8 bullets covering decisions, promises, unresolved threads, permanent consequences, and foreshadowed next steps

Keywords must be concrete nouns, objects, places, proper nouns, or distinctive actions.
Do not use abstract emotions, themes, or plot-summary phrases.

Return only the JSON object. No markdown fences. No commentary.`, 'STMemoryBooks_SummaryPrompt_Default'),

- Use member_ids whenever possible.

Rules:
