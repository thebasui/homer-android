- Bugfix: fixed sideprompt interval run save path.

## v6.1.0 (March 23, 2026)
- Improve auto-consolidation settings with multi-select target tiers.

## v4.6.3 (October 14, 2025)
- **Side Prompts Import is Now Additive:** Importing merges side prompts into your current set instead of replacing them. Existing prompts are preserved and only new prompts are added. If an imported prompt’s key conflicts with an existing one, the imported prompt is renamed using its display name (with a numeric suffix if needed).
- **Import UI Feedback Improved:** The import dialog now displays how many prompts were added and how many were renamed due to key conflicts.
- **Manual /sideprompt Name Lookup Greatly Improved:** The `/sideprompt` command now matches side prompts by key, display name, or slug (hyphen/underscore/space-insensitive, case-insensitive). For example, `/sideprompt cast-of-characters`, `/sideprompt cast`, and `/sideprompt "Cast of Characters"` will all run the same prompt if it exists.
- **Bugfix:** Resolves issues where built-in prompts could not be run by slug or key, or where imports previously overwrote existing side prompts.
- **Feature:** Side Prompts now support including previous memories for context (up to 7, matching main memory popup).
  - Added per-template "Previous memories for context" option to Side Prompt editor and new prompt dialog.
  - When set, up to 7 previous memories are fetched from the active lorebook and included in the side prompt input (in the same block format as main memory context).

  - New Side Prompts popup with quick toggles, inline editing, and clear visibility of active prompts
  - Side Prompts Manager for organizing prompts (create, duplicate, rename, delete, import/export)
  - Fully integrated into the generation pipeline; behavior remains unchanged unless Side Prompts are explicitly enabled

- **Enhancements / Refactors:**
  - Consolidated LLM generation code paths for maintainability and reduced duplication (utils.js, stmemory.js)

- **Fix:** Resolved race condition in scene memory creation.
- **Other:** Minor logic tweaks and UI polish.

## v4.2.5 (October 2025)
- Fix: Eliminated “EventEmitter: Cannot listen to undefined event” by removing the nonexistent `CHAT_LOADED` subscription and consolidating initialization into `CHAT_CHANGED` and `init()`.
